# How to contribute to Blockcore?

Blockcore is built and maintained entirely by volunteer contributors around the internet.
We welcome and appreciate new contributions, whether you're a developer, a five language speaking individual or an average Joe or Jane that want's to help in any way possible.

## Developers

If you're a developer looking to help, but you're not sure where to begin, check the [good first issue label](https://github.com/block-core/blockcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22), which contains small pieces of work that have been specifically flagged as being friendly to new contributors.

Contributors looking to do something a bit more challenging, before opening a pull request, please [create an issue](https://github.com/block-core/blockcore/issues/new/choose) or join [our community chat](https://discord.gg/fs4zjKcyTx) to get early feedback, discuss best ways to tackle the problem and to ensure there is no work duplication.

We are actively looking for developers who can take on and resolve GitHub issues and help with development. If you would like to help us, but need some guidance, the Discord is the place to ask questions.

See the [Development](/Development) section.

## Community

You can help Blockcore even if you're not a developer.

The easiest way is to use the software as a business or individual, provide feedback and [report any bugs or issues](https://github.com/block-core/blockcore/issues) you or your customers encounter. Another great way is to join the [community](./Community.md) and help others troubleshoot by sharing information you may have from your experience using Blockcore.

Consider helping newcomers like the community helped you.

## Documentation & Blog

Helping us keeping the present [Documentation](https://github.com/block-core/documentation) up-to-date is an important contribution because Blockcore evolves at each release.

Writing articles helps spread the word on new features being implemented, or provides tutorials on how to use them.

Both can be done by anyone, tech-savvy or not.

## Video & Graphics

Making videos that promote some features or that show how Blockcore works is a great way to help.

## Hosting Providers

The Blockcore community is looking for more VPS hosting providers to host public blockchain nodes, making them more decentralized and widely-available.

## Spreading the word
