# Block Explorer (local)

Local block explorer that can be used in combination with txindex=1 enabled on the node. This feature has API that allows the wallet UI to show block information locally. This enables full privacy blockchain insight.

## Local queries and index

This feature builds a local index of the blockchain that you can search using the API interface. It gives full privacy in terms of what address or transactions you are looking up.

This feature should not be mistaken for the Blockcore Explorer, which is a standalone software and can be made public available.
