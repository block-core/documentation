### Error: If you use an alternative order numbering system, please see class-wc-gateway-btcpay.php to apply a search filter

If by any chance you use a different order numbering than standard in WooCommerce, the following error may appear in your BTCPay WooCommerce plugin logs:

> [Error] The BTCPay payment plugin was called to process an IPN message but could not retrieve the order details for order_id: "ON123". If you use an alternative order numbering system, please see class-wc-gateway-btcpay.php to apply a search filter.

Paste the following code at the bottom of your child's theme **functions.php** file:

```php
function get_order_id_from_custom_order_style($orderid){
  if(is_string($orderid)){
    $result = preg_replace('~\D~', '', $orderid);
    return $result;
  }
  return $orderid;
}

add_filter('woocommerce_order_id_from_number', 'get_order_id_from_custom_order_style', 1);
```
