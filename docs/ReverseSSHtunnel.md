# Forward ports with a reverse SSH tunnel

## Advantages:

* no port forwarding needed on the LAN of the host
* encrypted connection
* hides the IP of the host

## Requirements:

* a Virtual Private Server (VPS) - eg. a minimal package on Lunanode for ~3.5$/month
* root access on the VPS - only root can forward ports under no. 1000
* ssh access to the host computer (where the ports will be forwarded from)

## On the host computer

* Check for an ssh public key:
`$ cat ./.ssh/*.pub`

* if there is none generate one (keep pressing ENTER):
`$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096`

* copy the ssh public key over to the VPS (fill in the VPS_IP_ADDRESS).
Will be prompted for the root password of the VPS.
`$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@VPS_IP_ADDRESS`

## Working on the VPS

* login as root or run:
`sudo su -`

* edit the sshd config:
`sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config`

* make sure these entries are active (uncommented, meaning there is no `#` at the beggining of the line).
Can just paste these on the end of the file:

```
RSAAuthentication yes
PubkeyAuthentication yes
GatewayPorts yes
AllowTcpForwarding yes
ClientAliveInterval 60
```

CTRL+O, ENTER to save, CTRL+X to exit.

* restart the sshd service (WARNING: you can lose access at this point if the config is wrong):
`sudo systemctl restart sshd`

## Back to the host computer

### Set up a systemd service

* create the service file:
`sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/autossh-tunnel.service`

* Paste the following and fill in the VPS_IP_ADDRESS.
Add or remove ports as required.

```ini
[Unit]
Description=AutoSSH tunnel service
After=network.target

[Service]
User=root
Group=root
Environment="AUTOSSH_GATETIME=0"
ExecStart=/usr/bin/autossh -C -M 0 -v -N -o "ServerAliveInterval=60" -R 9735:localhost:9735 -R 443:localhost:443 -R 80:localhost:80 -R root@VPS_IP_ADDRESS
StandardOutput=journal

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

* Enable and start the service:
`$ sudo systemctl enable autossh-tunnel`
`$ sudo systemctl start autossh-tunnel`

* The port forwarding with a reverse ssh-tunnel is now complete.
You should be able access the ports/services of the host computer through the IP of the VPS.

## Monitoring

* Check if there are any errors on the host computer:
`$ sudo journalctl -f -n 20  -u autossh-tunnel`

* To check if tunnel is active on the VPS:
`$ netstat -tulpn`
